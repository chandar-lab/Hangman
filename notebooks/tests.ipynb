It became the de facto capital during the Middle Ages and remained so through the French Revolution and modern times.\\n\\n4. **Geographical and Cultural Recognition**: Paris is widely recognized globally as France's capital, known for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and its role in art, fashion, and politics.\\n\\n5. **Elimination of Alternatives**: Other major French cities (e.g., Lyon, Marseille) are significant but not capitals.
