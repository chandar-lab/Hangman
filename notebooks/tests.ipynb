      "Okay, the user is asking for the capital of France and wants a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at the answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about France. France is a country in Europe, and I remember that Paris is its capital. But wait, maybe I should verify that to be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll think about major cities in France. Paris is definitely a big one, known for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. But are there other cities that might be considered capitals? For example, some countries have cities that are administrative centers but not the capital. However, in France's case, Paris is both the political and cultural center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I should consider if there's any possibility of confusion. Sometimes people might think of other cities like Lyon or Marseille, but those are not capitals. Lyon is known for its cuisine and historical significance, while Marseille is a major port city. So they're not the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another angle: checking historical context. Paris has been the capital of France for centuries, even through various political changes. The French Revolution, for instance, had significant events in Paris. The government, the president, and the parliament are all based in Paris. That reinforces that it's the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about neighboring countries. For example, Spain's capital is Madrid, Germany's is Berlin, and Italy's is Rome. France's capital being Paris fits with the pattern of major cities being capitals in Europe. No other European country has Paris as its capital, so that's a good check.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are there any exceptions or special cases? Well, France has regions and departments, but the capital is still Paris. There's no other city that serves as the seat of government for France. So, after considering these points, I can confidently say that Paris is the capital of France.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- 💬 Final Response ---\n",
      "The capital of France is **Paris**. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Geographical Knowledge**: France is a country in Western Europe. Its capital is widely recognized as Paris, a major global city known for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Political Center**: Paris serves as the political, economic, and cultural hub of France. The French government, including the President's residence (Élysée Palace) and the National Assembly, is based there.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Historical Context**: Paris has been the capital of France since the 13th century, even through periods of political upheaval (e.g., the French Revolution, World War II). This historical continuity reinforces its role as the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Elimination of Alternatives**: Other major French cities like Lyon, Marseille, or Bordeaux are not capitals. They are renowned for other reasons (e.g., Lyon for gastronomy, Marseille for its port) but lack the political and administrative significance of Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Global Recognition**: Paris is universally acknowledged as France's capital in international contexts, confirmed by travel guides, maps, and diplomatic references.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the conclusion is clear: **Paris is the capital of France**.\n"
