      "2. **Avoid “Condiments”** – Many soy sauces, sriracha, or vinaigrettes are surprisingly nut‑based.\n",

Quick Nut‑Free Home Dinner Idea – “Easy\\u202fQuinoa & Veggie Bowl”\\n\\n**Ingredients**\\n\\n| Item | Approx. Amount | Notes |\\n|------|----------------|-------|\\n| **Quinoa** | 1 cup | Rinse thoroughly |\\n| **Mixed Veggies** | 2 cups (bell peppers, zucchini, carrots, broccoli) | Fresh or frozen |\\n| **Chickpeas** | 1 can (drained & rinsed) | Adds protein |\\n| **Tahini** | 2 tbsp (optional, but keep out if you’re chicken‑allergic – basil or simple olive‑oil vinaigrette works great) | Check that it’s not mixed with nuts |\\n| **Fresh Lemon Juice** | 1 tbsp | Adds brightness |\\n| **Olive Oil** | 2 tbsp | For sauté |\\n| **Garlic** | 1 clove (minced) | Optional |\\n| **Salt / pepper** | To taste | |\\n| **Optional Garnishes** | Sliced avocado, chopped cilantro, roasted pumpkin seeds (if no nut allergy concerns) | |\\n\\n**Method**\\n\\n1. **Cook quinoa**: In 2 cups water, bring to boil → cover → simmer 15\\u202fmin → fluff.\\n2. **Sauté the veggies**: Heat olive oil in a skillet → garlic → add veggies → stir‑cook about 5‑7\\u202fmin until tender but still crisp.\\n3. **Combine**: Quinoa + sautéed veggies + chickpeas → gently fold.\\n4. **Dress**: Olive oil, lemon juice, optional tahini, salt, pepper → toss well.\\n5. **Serve**: Bowl out, top with avocado slices or a handful of pumpkin seeds if you want crunch.\\n\\n🕒 **Total Time:** ~25 minutes\\n\\nThis bowl is 100\\u202f% vegetarian, zero nuts, and easily adjustable. You can swap veggies based on what’s in season—cherry tomatoes, spinach, or even a handful of kale.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Quick Tips for Nut Allergies in SF\\n\\n1. **Speak Up** – Even if a place says “nut‑free,” ask for no cross‑contact with nut hoodsto or shake‑up containers.\\n2. **Avoid “Condiments”** – Many soy sauces, sriracha, or vinaigrettes are surprisingly nut‑based.\\n3. **Meet the Kitchen Staff** – Especially if you have an intense reaction history.\\n4. **Carry an EpiPen** – Always a good safety net if you’re prone to severe reactions.\\n\\nEnjoy your meal, Alex! If you need reservations, alternate cooking ideas, or something else, just let me know.'}],\n",

    "timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "# INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n",
    "2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n",
    "3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the\n",
    "memories\n",
    "4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n",
    "5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\",\n",
    "etc.), calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory\n",
    "from 4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n",
    "6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For\n",

    "memory timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n",

    "your work\n",
    "5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n",
