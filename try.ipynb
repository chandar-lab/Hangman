No, that's 8 letters. Let me check the difficulty. \"Butterfly\" has repeated letters which might make it easier. Maybe \"sunflower\"? That's 9 letters again. Hmm. What about \"chocolate\"? 9 letters. Maybe \"strawberry\"? 10 letters. Maybe a shorter word. \"Secret\"? 6 letters. But that's pretty common. \"Jupiter\"? 7 letters. Or \"calendar\"? 8 letters. Wait, \"calendar\" has some tricky letters like 'l' and 'd'. Alternatively, \"umbrella\"? 8 letters. Let me pick \"umbrella\". Let me check the letters: U, M, B, R, E, L, L, A. That has some vowels and consonants. The user can guess letters, and I can track the correct and incorrect guesses. Let me make sure there are no duplicate letters that might confuse. Wait, \"umbrella\" has two Ls. That's okay. Alright, I think that's a good choice. Let me confirm the word length: 8 letters. Alright, let's go with that.\n",
